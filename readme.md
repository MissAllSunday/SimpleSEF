###### Description:

This mod creates content filled URLs for your forum.

**For SMF 2.1.x only**

Examples:

```
yourboard.com/index.php?board=1.0 =>> yourboard.com/general_discussion/
yourboard.com/index.php?topic=1.0 =>> yourboard.com/general_discussion/welcome_smf_1.0.html
yourboard.com/index.php?action=profile =>> yourboard.com/profile[/nobbc]

```

###### Features:

- Makes no core code changes to SMF **AT ALL[**
- Works with Apache (mod_rewrite required) or IIS7 (Microsoft URL Rewrite module required + web.config files in your directory)
- Custom action handling for other mods
- Action ignoring- Prevent urls with certain actions from being rewritten.
- Action aliasing- change 'register' to 'signup' for example.
- Very low overhead to each page load- Average database query count per page load- 2 (with caching enabled, 3 without)
- 'Simple' mode, puts just the words 'board', 'topic' or 'user' into the url, instead of content filled urls
- Removes user specified words and characters from board and topic and usernames (thinks like ! $ &, etc, and short words, like 'the', 'at', 'and', etc.  These are customizable in the admin panel.
- Smart- when you add mods with new actions to your board, SimpleSEF readily recognizes the new ones and accounts for them without any interaction from you
- Specify the 'space' character in the URL (ie: general_discussion, general-discussion, general.discussion, etc)
- UTF-8 compatible, changes non-ASCII characters to their closes US-ASCII equivilant.

Post-Install Notes:
Please ensure your .htaccess or web.config file contains the proper information for this mod to work.  Visit the admin panel and click on the [Help] link at the end of the bolded text in the page description for more information.
